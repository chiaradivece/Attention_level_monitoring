# C.C.A.S.A.: Car Concentration And Security Assistant
IEIM 2016 Project, Bracco Filippo e Di Vece Chiara

The aim of the program is to detect particular conditions that are not compatible with safe driving by means of face and eye detection, making sure that the driver's eyes are on the road while the vehicle is moving and that the driver is not the victim of sleepiness. If these conditions are not met, the driver will be alerted with audible and visual warnings. 

## Source code
The executable file **codice.py** can be found in the folder *Sorgente*; it is possible to execute the code directly with Python, but remember to download the *Assets* folder containing files, images and audio necessary for the correct execution of the programme; the Python modules **cv2**, **Pyglet** and **numpy** are also required.

## Documentation
The documentation contains:
* a **Report.pdf** file: genesis and explanation of the functionality of the programme;
* one **Report.tex** file: source code of the .pdf file;
* one **presentation.html** file: more detailed explanation of the executable source code (divided into blocks for better understanding);
* one **presentation.ipynb** file: Jupiter notebook with code and comments;
